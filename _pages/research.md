# Research
Broadly, we work on how political institutions shape incentives to preserve the environment or exploit natural resources. We do this using new, high-dimensional sources of data including satellite imagery and human-generated text. This data allows us to generate insights at a local scale for large geographic areas or populations. Some of our ongoing projects are described below:

**Sub-national Electoral Deforestation Cycles Luke Sanford and Eliot Carlson** ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/belize.jpg){: style="width: 150px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}

In a first paper (Sanford 2021) describes the incentives that create higher rates of deforestation in election years. In a follow-up project, we extend the analysis to sub-national elections to test hypotheses about where politicians might choose to allow additional deforestation.

We use methods to make neural network predictions more interpretable to help make human persuasion more interpretable. We build a machine learning model which learns how text influences human decisions about government support for renewable energy, and then extract the features which are most predictive. We construct the model so that the features are clusters of human-interpretable phrases. We then take these phrases and test their persuasiveness in a randomized control trial. Methodologically, this paper connects research in machine learning interpretability to survey methodology methods. We allow researchers to discover how persuasive treatments are expressed "in the wild" rather than subjectively specified by researchers ex ante.

**The effects of land tenure formalization depend on the political setting--evidence from an RCT in Benin. Luke Sanford** ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/HTE_motivation.png){: style="width: 300px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}

I show that the positive effects of the Plan Fonciers Ruraux program in Benin are initially geographically concentrated in areas which have low initial levels of land tenure security. After an election in 2016 which reduced confidence in the judiciary and other formal institutions, the effect of the PFR is reduced significantly and is not distinguishable from zero. This paper shows the first evidence from an RCT that political factors moderate the effects of land tenure formalization.

In this paper I estimate the effects of a land tenure formalization program in the Alibori and Borgou departments of Benin on developmental and environmental outcomes. I develop a new impact evaluation approach, combining machine learning methods for satellite remote sensing data with a double machine learning approach to causal inference. The approach conditions the estimated effect on the series of satellite images taken in the two years before treatment was assigned. I validate this method by showing that I can recover estimates of effects from the randomized control trial even when I do use any information about the locations of the "control" units. I show that my approach can generate unbiased and more precise estimates at the village level, then demonstrate that it can be used to estimate the effects at the parcel level--something which has previously been impossible in land titling research without very strong assumptions. This allows me to estimate outcomes which are directly of interest to policymakers. Specifically, I find no effects of the land tenure formalization on treecover, other natural vegetation, or annual cropland. I find that there is evidence for the expansion of built up areas, but only outside of the titled parcels. I show that standard methods recover biased estimates of these effects. This method can be adapted to improve estimates the effects of many spatially targeted policies while accounting for a host of potential confounding variables common in coupled human-natural systems.

**Determining how much carbon carbon offsets offset. (LAB)**

We have early stage research in empirically estimating the amount of carbon that is truly offset when a landowner sells carbon offsets from their land. We are exploring how remote sensing should or should not be used to improve monitoring, best practices for extimating baseline scenarios, and how machine learning can help to minimize adverse selection on the part of offset sellers.

<!-- # Research

Our overarching goal is to explore and understand new quantum states of electronic matter on the atomic scale. To do so, we use and develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom.

Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics and instrumentation.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Scanning tunneling noise spectroscopy (STNS).** We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.


**Mott physics and high-temperature superconductivity.** Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.

**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

**Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren.

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
